        <br/> 
          Right now, this website is statically served from a "serverless" cloud provider. This is a list to track items being worked on or with plans for future builds.  If you are interested in working on a development team, or hosting mirrors or  Infinispan cache(keycloak) reach out. 
        </h3><h3><br/>
          Ultimately, our goal is to provide a community for project-based learning focused on the internet, web applications, and IoT. The projects we will be learning with will be for the benefit of local non-profits. 
        </h3><h3><br/>
          These organizations, especially in early development, are often fully volunteer-supported and run on shoestring budgets. Because of this, technology infrastructure and projects that could otherwise help them succeed in their mission fall by the wayside and go unbuilt or unfinished. Our hope is that volunteers looking to gain experience in information technology, software development, and cybersecurity can gain experience while building a portfolio of collaborative projects and providing an invaluable service to their community.    
          </h3><h3><br/>
          In addition to supporting other non-profits, it's our goal that hacloco can grow big enough to be able to support on-going opensource and decentralized projects. How this manifests is really up to everyone involved but many projects are too big for one developer. This means for them to grow, they either get taken over as pet projects by for-profit organizations that utilze them or, in the case of both proof-of-stake or proof-of-work crypto networks consolidated almost completely and ran as for profit entities. The hope is that there will be future member support for hosting validator nodes,  vpns or other services that can provide income to support the organization's growth while remaining true to values of protecting user data and privacy, as well as suporting net neutrality, opensource software and decentralization in support of an open and free internet.
